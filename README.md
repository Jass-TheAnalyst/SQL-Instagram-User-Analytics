  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><b>User analysis</b> involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software application or a mobile app. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the business. For example, the marketing team might use these insights to launch a new campaign, the product team might use them to decide on new features to build, and the development team might use them to improve the overall user experience.
